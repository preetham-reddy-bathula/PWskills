Non-relational databases, also known as NoSQL databases, are designed to store and manage data that does not fit neatly into traditional tables with rows and columns. NoSQL databases are preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where scalability, flexibility, and ease of data modeling are important. MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where the data is unstructured, dynamic, and rapidly changing, such as in social media applications, content management systems, and e-commerce platforms."
