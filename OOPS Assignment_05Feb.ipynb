    "Class and Object in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are two fundamental concepts. A class is a blueprint that defines the properties and behaviors of an object. An object is an instance of a class, created at runtime. For example, a \"Car\" class can have properties such as make, model, year, color, and behaviors such as start, stop, drive. A specific car object can have values for these properties, such as \"Toyota\", \"Camry\", \"2020\", \"red\"."
